☁️ One of my most recent personal projects is a Data Streaming project where I used Apache Kafka and Flink to do real time streaming and stream processing on a video game called DuckHunt, the idea is to have real-time feedback while playing the game and to have a live leaderboard of other players in the same session as you. ☁️ <br>
